# Dvorak Custom layout
Custom keyboard layout to use with my macbook pro. It's a modified version of Dvorak Programmer.
- Base Layout: Dvorak Programmer (because I'm fancy like that).
- Numbers: Rearranged to match QWERTY—because muscle memory is a thing.
- Cmd: Turns—QWERTY mode for convenience. Less keyboard gymnastics for copy-pasta!
- Option + e: Accent tilde for spanish writting

Brasically, it's Dvorak, but with a few tricks.

# U.S. Custom layout
It's also nice to have the 'US Programmer' QWERTY custom bundle up your sleeve.
